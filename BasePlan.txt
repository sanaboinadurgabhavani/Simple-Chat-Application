                                        Base Plan

1. Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
HTML/CSS: Design a clean and simple user interface with a login page and a chat room 
interface. Use CSS to style the layout and improve usability.
JavaScript: Use JavaScript to manage user interactions, such as sending and 
receiving messages in real-time.

2. Backend (Java, JDBC, Servlet, Hibernate, Spring Boot)
User Authentication: Use Servlets and JDBC to handle user login and registration, 
validating user credentials against an SQL database.
Message Storage: Use Hibernate to manage messages and store them in the database, 
allowing users to view previous chats.
Message Handling: Use Spring Boot with WebSocket or RESTful APIs for message handling,
ensuring real-time updates in the chat room.

3. Database (SQL)
Design tables for users (with details like username and password) and messages (with details 
like sender, receiver, timestamp, and content).
With these elements, your chat application will allow users to log in, send messages, and view 
chat history.
